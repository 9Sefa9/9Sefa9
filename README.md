<h1 align="center">Hey! My name is Sefa. 🤓</h1>

<h2 align="center">My name is Sefa Gövercin, and I’m a recent computer science graduate from University Duisburg-Essen👨‍🎓.
Developing applications is one of my passion and inspires me to learn more technologies.
I develope mobile games in my free time and created an indie-game development team in 2017
called Sourberry Games. At that moment it was an awesome experience to keep in one hand
the responsibility as a leader and in the other hand to communicate with skilled developers remotely😎.
This path showed me other aspects of creating applications especially for mobile.
I speak Java fluently but got basic knowledges in similar programming languages like C, C++, C#🔀.
I started in August 2020 with learning fundamentals in front-end technologies e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript😍.
My goal is to learn programming languages that fits to a Full-Stack and are mostly used in industries(for example MERN).
I also spend my time with watching anime, playing guitar and listening to various music directions for example LoFi, ChillHop and/or Rainy Jazz, 1 Hour anime music🎵.<br><br>that's it !!<br><br>
Thank you for reading and have a nice day!😊</h2>
